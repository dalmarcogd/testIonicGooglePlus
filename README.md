# The Ionic Super Starter with  Google Plus Example ðŸŽ®

The Ionic Super Starter is a batteries-included starter project for Ionic apps
complete with pre-built pages, providers, and best practices for Ionic
development.

The goal of the Super Starter is to get you from zero to app store faster than
before, with a set of opinions from the Ionic team around page layout,
data/user management, and project structure.

The way to use this starter is to pick and choose the various page types you
want use, and remove the ones you don't. If you want a blank slate, this
starter isn't for you (use the `blank` type instead).

One of the big advances in Ionic was moving from a rigid route-based navigation
system to a flexible push/pop navigation system modeled off common native SDKs.
We've embraced this pattern to provide a set of reusable pages that can be
navigated to anywhere in the app. Take a look at the [Settings
page](https://github.com/ionic-team/starters/blob/master/ionic-angular/official/super/src/pages/settings/settings.html)
for a cool example of a page navigating to itself to provide a different UI
without duplicating code.
